A smart, API-driven solution for assigning support tickets. This project intelligently prioritizes critical issues, matches tickets to the right agent skills, and ensures a balanced workload across the team. Our solution is designed as a robust, stateful, and scalable microservice.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works: The Assignment Logic

Our system processes tickets in a logical, multi-step flow to find the best agent for each job.

**Ticket Processing Flow:**

`Start` -> `Load Agent Workloads from File` -> `Prioritize All Tickets (Urgent First)` -> `Assign Tickets One-by-One` -> `Update Agent Workloads in Real-Time` -> `Save Final Workloads to File` -> `End`

**Finding the Best Agent (for each ticket):**

`Score Agent's Skills` + `Score Agent's Current Load` + `Score Agent's Experience` -> **`Final Suitability Score`**

The agent with the highest score gets the ticket.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üî• Intelligent Prioritization Engine
Before any assignments are made, our system first ranks every ticket to ensure the most critical issues are addressed first. This is not a simple keyword search; it's a weighted scoring system.

**How it works:**
1.  **Weighted Keywords:** We use a predefined dictionary of urgency keywords, each with a numerical weight (e.g., `critical: 5`, `outage: 5`, `request: 1`).
2.  **Priority Scoring:** Each ticket's title and description are scanned. A total `priority_score` is calculated by summing the weights of any keywords found.
3.  **Timestamp Tie-Breaker:** To ensure fairness, older tickets are given a slight priority boost if their urgency scores are identical.
4.  **Final Sorting:** The entire list of tickets is then sorted based on this score, placing the most critical and oldest issues at the very top of the assignment queue.

This means a ticket containing **"server outage"** will always be processed before a ticket for a **"software request"**, regardless of when they were submitted.

### üß† Smart Multi-Factor Scoring
We calculate a holistic "suitability score" for every agent-ticket pair. The agent with the highest score is chosen. This score is a blend of:
*   **Skill Match:** How well the ticket's content matches an agent's skills.
*   **Load Balancing:** Agents with less work are strongly preferred.
*   **Experience:** Used as a tie-breaker between otherwise equal agents.

### üíæ Stateful & Persistent Workloads
The system has memory. It reads and writes agent workloads to a local `agent_state.json` file. This ensures that the load balancing is fair and effective across multiple batches of tickets over time.

### ‚ö° Fast & Modern API
Built with **FastAPI**, our solution is a high-performance web service. It comes with automatic, interactive API documentation for easy testing and professional demos.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **üß† Smart Scoring:** We don't just match keywords. Our algorithm calculates a weighted score based on:
    *   **Skill Match:** How well the ticket's content matches an agent's skills.
    *   **Load Balancing:** Agents with less work are strongly preferred.
    *   **Urgency:** Critical issues are always handled first.

*   **üíæ Stateful Workloads:** The system remembers agent workloads between API calls by saving them to a local `agent_state.json` file. This ensures the load balancing is fair and effective over time.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run and Test

Get the project running in just a few steps.

### 1. Setup
First, clone the repository and install the necessary packages.
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone [your-repo-url]
cd [your-repo-folder]

# Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

uvicorn main:app --reload```
The server will be live at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### 3. Test the Service

**Option A: Interactive API Docs (Best for a Demo)**
1.  Open your browser to **[http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)**.
2.  Expand the `POST /v1/ticket-assignment` endpoint.
3.  Click "**Try it out**", paste your `dataset.json` content into the request body, and click "**Execute**".

**Option B: Test Script**
1.  Keep the server running.
2.  Open a **new terminal** and run:
    ```bash
    python test_api.py
    ```
The script will call the API and print a summary of the results.

## üîÆ Future Improvements

*   **Smarter Analysis:** Use an AI model to understand ticket text more deeply.
*   **Database Integration:** Switch from a JSON file to a SQLite database for better data management.
*   **Real-time Processing:** Use WebSockets to handle tickets as soon as they are created.
